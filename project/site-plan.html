For the past two years I have been married to a incredible woman and we have a energetic and loving daugther. We live in Berlin, Germany.

        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        My intention is make all the pages look the same in terms of the logo, nav, footer and if possible the hero.
